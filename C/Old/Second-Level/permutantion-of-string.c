// Strings are usually ordered in lexicographical order. 
// That means they are ordered by comparing their leftmost different characters. 
// For example, abc<abd because c<d . Also  because . 
// If one string is an exact prefix of the other it is lexicographically smaller, e.g., .
// Given an array of strings sorted in lexicographical order, print all of its permutations in 
// strict lexicographical order. If two permutations look the same, only print one of them. 
// See the 'note' below for an example.
// Complete the function next_permutation which generates the permutations in the described order.
